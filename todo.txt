How can we save the auth keys 

Product:

Interactive library to ship react components to any use with just their webflow api token?

1. which env variables are public and which are private?

vercel offer oauth and so does webflow
user logs in with both - we should have all the appropriate scope to generate AND push the webflow components

I will handle the devops - 
- create webcn - our library by forking this repo
- investigate how the user can select which components the user needs: run the library share command with a manifest
    - webflow.json(?) tells the compiler which patterns to search for for compilation
